# A-download-manager-ADM-
A download manager, that checks for any type of malware.

Enter your link in the files tab, and it automatically checks for any malware. It makes you download it safely and securely!

I've also made an application for ADM, just download "Setup.exe" from the file list.
Installation steps: 
1. Disable your antivirus ( to prevent any files being deleted )
2. Download the "Setup.exe"
3. It will begin installing when your double-click the file.
4. If done sucessfully, you now have a free to use, reliable and cool-looking download manager that checks for any malware!
